## For example

### trying a new restaurant

15 minutes ago, 3.5 meters away from where you are, somebody shared "My seafood risoto was awesome but my partner was disapointed by his steak."

### walking in the street

5 minutes ago, 200 meters away, the owner of that fancy french bakery shared "closing in 30 minutes; all cakes are 60% off"
